###Introduction
Module `rocketmq-babel` gets its name from Holly Bible, [Tower of Babel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel), meaning everyone speaks one common language.
This module is to enable virtually all other languages supported by [Thrift Project](http://thrift.apache.org) to
send/receive message to/from RocketMQ broker.

###Example Usage
You may find example usage in form of Java.

1. ProducerClient
2. ConsumerClient

If you choose to use a language other than Java, say Python, Php, C, C++, all you need to do is implement clients similar to these two listed above.
